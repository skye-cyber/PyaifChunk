# PyChunkCore

## Overview
**PyChunkCore** is an advanced chunk-processing module that serves as a **drop-in replacement** for Python's deprecated `chunk` module. It extends the functionality by integrating `pychunk`, making it compatible with legacy and modern systems.

### Key Features
‚úÖ Fully compatible with Python 3.12 and 3.13+  
‚úÖ Implements both `chunk` and `pychunk` in a unified package  
‚úÖ Supports **big-endian** and **little-endian** file parsing  
‚úÖ Provides enhanced performance and additional utilities  
‚úÖ Acts as a seamless bridge for `aifc` and other legacy modules

---
## Installation
Install via **pip**:
```sh
pip install pychunkcore
```

Or install from source:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PyChunkCore.git
cd PyChunkCore
pip install .
```

---
## Usage
### Basic Example
```python
from pyaifchunk.core_chunk import Chunk

with open("example.wav", "rb") as file:
    chunk = Chunk(file)
    print("Chunk Name:", chunk.getname())
    print("Chunk Size:", chunk.getsize())
    data = chunk.read()
    chunk.close()
```

### Handling AIFF Files (`aifc` Module Compatibility)
```python
from pyaifchunk.core_aifc import open # PyChunkCore ensures aifc works properly

with aifc.open("example.aiff", "rb") as af:
    print("Audio Params:", af.getparams())
    print("Sample Width:", af.getsampwidth())
```

---
## Compatibility
PyChunkCore is designed to work with **Python 3.12+**, ensuring compatibility with modules like `aifc` that previously relied on `chunk`.

### Supported Platforms
‚úÖ Windows  
‚úÖ Linux  
‚úÖ macOS
